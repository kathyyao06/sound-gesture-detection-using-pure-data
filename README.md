# Sound Gesture Classifier Using Pure Data

A robust classifier that detects six sound gestures by their sound signature, using pure data. The classifier will perform a different linux command for every sound made. Here, sounds are detected using strong features over weak features. This utilizes features of sound such as timbre and frequency.

## Six Sound Gestures
- Knocking on a table -> Prints the date
- Tapping on the computer microphone -> Prints the time
- "Shhh" sound with mouth -> pwd linux command
- Shaking a blender bottle -> df linux command
- Crinkling plastic -> ls -l linux command
- Hitting a couch with palm -> ls linux command
